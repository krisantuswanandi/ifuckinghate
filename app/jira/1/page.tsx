        JIRA. Fucking JIRA. Everybody just fucking hates it. It tops the list of
        shit pieces of software by a fair margin, followed by JIRA in second
        place and JIRA in 3rd. It&apos;s fucking unusable without superpowers
        and endless patience. It does whatever it goddamn pleases and randomly
        sends your precious input that you so carefully crafted anxiously
        avoiding to press one wrong key to the happy hunting grounds.
